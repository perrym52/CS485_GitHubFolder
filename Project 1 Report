Assignment 1: Ball Adventure
	Ball Adventure is a simple and short game consisting of a dozen levels where the player takes control of a ball with the objective of rolling it into a spinning spiral. This is done by either using the keyboard arrows on a computer or by rotating the android device in the direction the player wishes to go.  The challenge is to not touch anything including the walls and prefab spinning obstacles.
	In this assignment I created and apply a basic texture onto a GameObject, created new scenes, and adjust camera and lighting. I applied previously learned techniques in this assignment such as prefab creation, and controls on the keyboard. Tutorials helped me learn how to add music into a scene and allow it to continue to playing throughout different scenes when navigating to them. I also learned to create motion controls for android and export the file as an .apk file. Future improvements I would may include creating a variety of obstacles and levels, and effects for entering the next scene.
